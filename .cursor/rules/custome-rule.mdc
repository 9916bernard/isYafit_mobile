### YOU MUST
- Only modify code that is **directly related to the user’s request**.
- Do **not** edit any other part of the code that is **not required** for the user’s request.
- Ensure that your edits do **not unintentionally change other functionality** outside the intended scope.

### IF UNSURE

Ask the user for clarification **instead of making assumptions**.
