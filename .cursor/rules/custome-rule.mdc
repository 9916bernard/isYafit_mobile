### YOU MUST
- Only modify code that is **directly related to the user’s request**.
- Do **not** edit any other part of the code that is **not required** for the user’s request.
- Ensure that your edits do **not unintentionally change other functionality** outside the intended scope.
- Only modify logic that is **clearly related to the protocol mentioned in the user request**
- If you must modify a method that affects multiple protocols, make sure to **handle exceptions or side effects carefully** to avoid unintended impact on other protocols.
- Ask user before deleting/creating a file or folder. 

### IF UNSURE
Ask the user for clarification **instead of making assumptions**.
