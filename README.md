## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React Native**  
  The main framework for building cross-platform (iOS and Android) mobile apps.
- **TypeScript**  
  Used across the codebase for type safety and maintainability.
- **react-native-vector-icons**  
  For icons and enhanced UI elements.
- **react-native-safe-area-context**  
  For proper UI rendering on devices with notches and safe areas.
- **react-native-linear-gradient**  
  For gradient backgrounds and UI styling.
- **react-native-root-toast**  
  For toast notifications and alerts.
- **i18next**  
  For internationalization and language support.

### Backend / Device Communication

- **react-native-ble-plx**  
  Used to manage Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connections to devices.
- **Custom FTMSManager and Protocol Managers**  
  Provides logic for device connection, protocol auto-detection, authentication, command sending, and data parsing for a variety of device protocols (FTMS, MOBI, REBORN, TACX, FITSHOW, CPS, etc.).
- **AsyncStorage (@react-native-async-storage/async-storage)**  
  For storing past reports and persistent data locally on device.

### Other Libraries

- **Expo modules**  
  Some integrations for application lifecycle management.
- **Android Native Modules**  
  Located in `android/app/src/main/java`, for deep integration with the platform as required by React Native.
